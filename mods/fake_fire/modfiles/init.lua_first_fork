The 'Fake-Fire' mod was originally created by Semmett9.

I've customized it a bit:
   * Health-damage disabled
   * Waving flames added
   * Never-ending flint and steel disabled
   * Extinguishing with water and lava(??) disabled

I commented out this part because:
   1. water and lava buckets have been disabled on the server,
   2. putting out fire with lava would only make a big mess, and

As for 'realism':
   * C'mon... This is *fake* fire.
   * Torches have long been impervious to water.
   * Minetest creates surreal worlds so it's OK if some things aren't perfectly realistic.
 
Besides, the fake-fire can be put out by punching it - simple and effective. ~ LazyJ, 2014_03_14

These next two sections of code are a real bonus that I figured out how to pull-off. ;)

The first section creates animated smoke. Trying to figure out how to make the animation appear to go upward was a headache.

The second section places the animated smoke *only* above the fake-fire *if* there is nothing but air straight above the fake-fire. I also made the smoke skip a space so it looks more like puffs of smoke and made it stretch high enough to be used in chimneys. For large builds, a second fake-fire will have to be hidden close to the top of the chimney so the smoke will be visible. The smoke also emmits a low-level light.

Yup, I'm proud of this little addition I've made to Semmett9's mod. :D

-- Ok, let's make some animated smoke.

minetest.register_node("fake_fire:smoke", {
	description = "Smoke",
	drawtype = "plantlike",
	waving = 1,
	light_source = 3,
	tiles = {
		{
			image="fake_fire_smoke_animated.png",
			animation={type="vertical_frames", aspect_w=16, aspect_h=16, length=2.0}
		},
	},
	use_texture_alpha = true,
	paramtype = "light",
	is_ground_content = false,
	walkable = false,
	drop = "",
	groups = {leafdecay=1,dig_immediate=3,not_in_creative_inventory=1},  -- The leafdecay makes the smoke disappear if the flame is removed. The catch is, because it depends on the leafdecay ABM, if the smoke is near a tree the smoke won't disappear if the flame is removed. Eh, minor issue not worth fretting over. ~ LazyJ, 2014_03_16
})




-- Now, let's make the animated smoke appear above the fake-fire.

minetest.register_abm({
	nodenames = {"fake_fire:fake_fire"},
	interval = 1,
	chance = 1,
	action = function(pos, node)
		local above = {x=pos.x, y=pos.y+1, z=pos.z}
		local name = minetest.get_node(above).name
		if name == "air" or name == "fake_fire:smoke" then
			pos.y = pos.y+1
			local height = 0
			while minetest.get_node(pos).name == "fake_fire:smoke" and height < 7 do
				height = height+1
				pos.y = pos.y+2
			end
			if height < 7 then
				if minetest.get_node(pos).name == "air" then
					minetest.set_node(pos, {name="fake_fire:smoke"})
				end
